#!/bin/sh
# codex-mark.sh — the ONLY sanctioned writer of the Codex review marker.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Run the Codex review with output teed to the log:
#        node <plugin>/scripts/codex-companion.mjs review "..." \
#          | tee "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/codex-review.log"
#   2. Then run:  ~/.claude/hooks/codex-mark.sh
#      (optional first arg = alternate log path)
#
# The review brief MUST instruct Codex to end with one final line:
#   CODEX_VERDICT: P0=<n> P1=<n> P2=<n> P3=<n>   (counting OPEN findings)
#
# Behavior (kerby verdict vocabulary):
#   PASS   (exit 0) — P0=0 and P1=0: writes the marker, resets the round
#                     counter, appends to the audit log, prints the PR-note line.
#   DENIED (exit 1) — open P0/P1 within the cap: fix, scoped re-review, re-mark.
#   HELD   (exit 2) — open P0/P1 at round >= 3: stop, escalate to the user.
#
# Fail-closed: no verdict line, dirty worktree, or stale log => no marker.
# Known ceiling: this trusts the teed log's content. Forging a log is
# possible, but that is deliberate deception, not drift; the audit log
# ($GIT_DIR/codex-review-audit.log) keeps the history visible.
